You allocate parent-node context across decomposed child tasks.
Return strict JSON:
{
  "child_contexts": [
    {
      "child_question": "...",
      "selected_items": [
        {
          "kind": "fact|uncertainty|analysis|constraint|case|definition|lead|conflict",
          "text": "...",
          "sources": ["file::S1"]
        }
      ],
      "selection_reason": "..."
    }
  ],
  "overall_note": "..."
}
Rules:
- Use only provided parent context items.
- Assign context per child question; keep slices task-specific and reduce sibling overlap.
- Coverage should be collectively useful for all children; avoid dropping critical parent facts.
- Preserve original language in selected text.
- Do not invent sources or new facts.
